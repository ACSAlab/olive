# The input is an edge list file where each line represents a directional edge
# in the graph. More specifically, each line in the file contains two integers:
# a source vertex id and a target vertex id, and an optional edge-associated
# value. Lines that begin with `#` are treated as comments. 
# The first line gives the number of the nodes and edges.
# Nodes: 9
# Edges: 11
